# Detect-and-Segment-Tumor
The project was to detect and segment tumors from MRI images.

Steps:
1. Take MRI image
2. Apply Anisotropic diffusion Filter for smoothing the image
3. Morphological operation for processing
4. Density and area based detection of tumor 
5. If there is tumor, estimate the tumor location if not show no tumor detected.
6. Tumor segmentation by a particular border 

How to run the code:
1. Run Brain_Tumor.m
2. While asking for the image choose any from dataset (there are two options, benign and malignant)

Future Plan: Still work in going on for detecting tumor with more accuracy.
